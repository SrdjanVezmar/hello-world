# hello-world
Hello There.
My name is Srdjan I'm coming from Serbia, lived 5yrs in UK and my next stop is Switzerland.
I'm all into Front-End Developent, started from basics like HTML5 nd CSS3 and now spending most of my time 
on JavaScript and CSS Animation. Also have done few CEO courses and few about using and implementing Saas.
Still new in this world but everyday spending on more and more experimanting happier I am.
